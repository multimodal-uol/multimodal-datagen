She said the new “stay alert” message was too “vague and imprecise” to be used.\n\nSturgeon told BBC Scotland Johnson needed to be much clearer that his proposed easing of the lockdown only related to England.\n\nMark Drakeford, first minister of Wales, emphasised that the country’s stay-at-home advice “has not changed”. He announced on Friday that Wales will allow more frequent exercise and the opening of garden centres, but said schools will not reopen from 1 June.\n\nJohnson will set out further details of his approach to parliament on Monday, publishing a document that will set out a roadmap for reopening the economy. This is likely to include ambitions for:\n\nShops and primary schools to return from 1 June, starting with reception, year one and year six. It is understood he would also want nurseries and other early years providers to return at the earliest opportunity.\n\nSecondary school pupils sitting exams next year to be given an opportunity to see their teachers before the end of term but there are no plans for other secondary pupils to return to school before the next school year.\n\nSome of the hospitality industry and other public places to reopen “provided they are safe and enforce social distancing”. He was not specific about which hospitality venues could reopen but it is understood that it means a return for cafes and restaurants with outdoor space that can enforce social distancing, rather than pubs, even ones with beer gardens.\n\nPeople in England to be allowed to sit in parks within their household groups, to drive to beauty spots for walks and take unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. People will be able to meet and sit down with a single other person outdoors as long as they stay two metres apart. Angling, swimming in lakes or rivers, tennis and golf will all be allowed if people are sticking to their household groups.\n\nThe speech omitted guidance on the wearing of face masks but this is likely to be included in Monday’s document, advising non-medical masks in enclosed public places such as public transport.\n\nIt also had no detail on when people may be able to meet with friends and family in groups again.\n\nStressing that the UK would take a careful approach, he said these were the first of “slow and gradual changes” but people would face higher fines for breaking the rules and the government could reimpose stricter rules if the virus starts to spread uncontrollably again. Fines could start at £100 and double for further offences, up to a maximum of £3,200.\n\n“If there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes,” he said.\n\nAnother tightening of the rules will involve quarantining people coming to the UK from abroad for 14 days, although this might only apply to travel by plane.\n\n“To prevent reinfection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time – with transmission significantly lower – to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air,” Johnson said.\n\nNo 10 also suggested there may be no quarantine for people travelling from France after a phone call with French president Emmanuel Macron. “No quarantine measures would apply to travellers coming from France at this stage; any measures on either side would be taken in a concerted and reciprocal manner,” a spokesman said.\n\nJohnson’s move towards the “stay alert” message signals the government’s intention to try to get people back to work, rather than staying at home in all circumstances.\n\nBut trade unions have not agreed new workplace guidance and Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: “The return to work must be safe. There must be no cutting corners, no playing fast and loose with employees’ safety. The economy is important, but lives are too.”\n\nLen McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, also raised concerns about people heading back to work before mandatory safety rules are agreed. “This has not been thought through and the failure to do so places working people in danger.”\n\nJohnson explained the government would adopt a new “five-level” threat system to describe the risk the UK faces from coronavirus, saying the UK was currently still at the second most serious level of four. The “Covid Alert System” would be run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre, Johnson added.\n\nHe added: “We have a route, and we have a plan, and everyone in government has the all-consuming pressure and challenge to save lives, restore livelihoods and gradually restore the freedoms that we need.”'}]
